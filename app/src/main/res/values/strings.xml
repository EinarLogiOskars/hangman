    <string name="about_text">Hangman is a game in which you try to save the
        stickman from being hanged. You have to guess the
        word shown on screen as a certain amount of
        stars * where each star represents a letter in
        the word. After failing six times the stickman
        is hanged and you lose the game. Your only chance
        to win the game is by completing the word in six
        tries or less and therefore saving the poor guy
        from hanging.
